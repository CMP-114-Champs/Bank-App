## Description
Description: The bank app created as shown above is designed to simulate basic banking operations; creating an account, checking account balances, depositing and withdrawing money. This README provides a description of the Bank-App, it's functions and how it can be used effectively. 


## Features
The bank app has the following features; 
Creating a new account-The user can create a new bank account and deposit an initial amount to activate the account.
Depositing and Withdrawing-The user can also withdraw from the amount initially deposited and also deposit more as he/she deems needful.

## Bank App Technologies
The code was written with Python programming language. The tkinter module in python was used to create the application as it allows fast and easy creation of Graphic User-Interface application like this one.
We used Python programming language because it is user friendly and easy to understand.

## STEP-BY-STEP TO USE THE BANK APPLICATION
Customer Request: A bank transaction begins when a customer initiates a request for a specific financial service. Whether it's withdrawing cash, depositing funds, the customer's needs set the transaction in motion.

Transaction Details: With authorization granted, the customer provides the necessary transaction details. This includes specifying the amount to be transacted or furnishing any additional relevant instructions.

Processing: The bank's system processes the transaction, employing various technologies and interfaces.

Settlement: During the settlement phase, the transaction is finalized and necessary adjustments are made to the involved accounts.

Confirmation: To provide peace of mind, the bank issues a confirmation to the customer, acknowledging the successful completion of the transaction. This confirmation can be delivered through an on-screen message.
